"Zikang Wu",5,5,5,5,5,"The team leader ","jiwenhan"
"Zikang Wu",4,4,4,5,4,"This teammate can improve by possibly providing updates and scheduling for the team more in advance to help with team efficiency. ","lehuynhat"
"Zikang Wu",2,4,3,3,3,"Zikang was our team leader. He did a sufficient job of keeping the team relatively on track. He was also in charge of the barrel system. He had the ability to conduct dynamic analysis on the barrel when firing, but in general did not seem to have a strong grasp of relevant skills and abilities. He also spoke very quickly with incorrect grammar and word choices. He tried to communicate, but it was often very difficult to understand him.","mardirossiankevingarovolz"
"Zikang Wu",5,5,4,5,5,"Kept the team on track and worked in different areas of the project. Great team leader. Could have better communicated the team schedule with the team each week. ","navaariellebernadette"
"Zikang Wu",4,4,4,5,3,"Need for more rational planning of the division of work and preparation of more detailed responses to failures","wuzikang"
"Zijian Zhu",5,5,4,5,5,"Produced excellent work but had a few communication and attendance issues. We have discussed this and have created a plan to move forward as a team.","awerkampbrettethan"
"Zijian Zhu",4,5,4,4,4,"Can be more firm when having an opinion.","chongjoshua"
"Zijian Zhu",5,5,4,5,5,"Zijian was always working hard on the electrical work but sometimes he could have communicated what he had accomplished a little better","ishakkyrollosmatthew"

"Zijian Zhu",5,5,5,5,5,"I can improve by having better presentation skills","zhuzijian"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",3,1,2,1,3,"Could have been more communicative with us. He was not around for most of the project. I don't think he knew my name but I could be wrong. I get he was working but it set us back a lot in progress.","lensangchristianfeivelaustine"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",5,5,4,3,5,"need to communicate better","lizhuangzhuang"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",1,1,1,1,1,"He only showed up to the presentations, never the lab sections. His did not put much thought into the laxy susan which ending up being too small which affected the stability of our launcher. He did not do anything useful and mostly just stood there when we were assembling the launcher. He always used the excuse of ""I have work"".","luubrian"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",2,1,3,1,3,"Awful team member mainly because of lack of communication and never being present except for presentations. Didn't work on his role until told to work on it.","ramosjohnpatrickjavier"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",2,1,1,1,1,"Zhuangzhuang was not communicative and only did a little bit of work, he can improve on this by communicating better and putting more time in to help the team","sardiscoanthonydomenickjr"
"Zhuangzhuang Li",3,1,1,1,1,"Didn't really help the team at all, barely showed up to meetings, and he barely communicated ","vargasnicholasalexander"

"Xuan Yang",5,4,4,5,4,"Xuan need to do better job for his work","yangxuan"
"William Trong Duc Tran",3,2,4,3,3,"William contributed to the team when it came to matters of our class assignments. However, I feel like his involvement in the project was lacking. To be fair, William had a rough quarter with a lot of classes, and is, from what I've heard, ready to pick-up the pace next quarter. Other than contributing more to the project, I'd advice William to be more open about the problems he could be facing with the project. If the team is made aware of a problem a teammate is having, we can work together to overcome it. ","perezwilfredo"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,2,5,4,4,"William is confusing. He keeps track of class dealines more than the rest of the group but he doesn't seem to feel any time pressure from Velez himself which is confusing. At the beginning og the project he decided to work on the simulations and doe not seem to have much to show for himself. I would advise him that he needs to take time to learnt he software on his own. I know that he has had trouble sheduling meeting with Velez and the masters student to learn from them and it feels like he is using that as an excuse to not persue learning on his own. ","robinsonbridgedarrah"
"William Trong Duc Tran",3,4,5,4,4,"Good secondary leader focused on keeping team together and motivated. Could not contribute to the project too much though due to the complexity of simulations as well as a lack of training until late into the quarter. Did my fair share of week for the class assignments though.","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,4,4,5,4,"William is learning the simulations as fast as he can while working with professor Velez, but for this next quarter, his simulations are needed at a much earlier time so hopefully he is able to abide by a timeline like that. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Wilfredo Perez",3,3,5,3,4,"Although I had a general idea of what everyone was working on, I did not know specifically what every member should have been doing at every point in time. If I am being honest, I think I did my fair share of the work. I could have contributed more, but school was not a priority for me this quarter. I will try to set up more time next quarter so I can contribute more if needed, though I'd like to avoid doing other people's work.","perezwilfredo"
"Wilfredo Perez",3,3,2,1,3,"Wilfredo does not seem to understand the concept of a senior desing course or that it is supposed to be important and somewhat of a priority. He consistently does work at the last minute. He did told us he can't do any wrok during week 11 until after his final at 3:30 on thursday which is crazy because the final slides are due on Friday. Clealry he isn't managing his time well if he waited this late to study for his exam which is not something that should detract from the groups progress. He consistently asks questions about the most basic aspects of the project during our meetings even as late as week 9 which leads me to believe he is lacking basic understanding of the project and that is why he is procrastinating on working. ","robinsonbridgedarrah"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,4,5,3,4,"Struggled with time management and often put other classes first, but still did his share of work by the deadlines. Very friendly and easy to work with.","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"Wilfredo Perez",3,3,2,2,2,"Wilfredo is very determined in his work. He has a lot to learn in regards to content and experience and you can tell from interactions with him. He is unsure of himself and that is probably the best way he can improve his rating, by being confident in his work and not needing reassurance throughout the project. All of my previous comments on wilfredo are still true but furthermore, his contirbution to the project decreased a little and he made it a little difficult to work with him not being very flexible with time frames. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Wenhan Ji",5,5,5,5,4,"Great effort for the assigned part of the project and willingly to help other team members at all time","jiwenhan"
"Wenhan Ji",4,3,4,4,5,"This teammate can improve by being more active and involve within team discussion to provide more insight and perspective for the team","lehuynhat"
"Wenhan Ji",1,2,1,1,1,"Wenhan did not seem to have any interest in the project, or engineering in general. Did not contribute at any stage beyond concept generation. He showed up to meetings, but I'm not sure what he did. He spent most of the team - time speaking Mandarin with Zikang.","mardirossiankevingarovolz"
"Wenhan Ji",3,3,4,3,3,"Does his share of work. Could be more outspoken with input and ideas during groupwork.","navaariellebernadette"

"Vincenzo Ethan Pizano",4,3,2,2,2,"I, Vincenzo, displayed good work and managed a bit in terms of timing to make sure we were making progress on time, but part way through I started slacking on team management and became harsher/stubborn in terms of vision of the project. I expected high-quality work from myself and my teammates, but felt the stress from other classes and management of the team to the point where I was aggressive and disappointed with our time scaling and quality.","pizanovincenzoethan"

"Vince Tran",5,5,5,5,5,"Vince really stepped up as a teammate during the last part of this project. He was constantly making sure everyone was getting their work done properly and on time. ","overholserashlynn"
"Vince Tran",4,5,5,4,4,"Vince is awesome. Pretty much been keeping us on top of stuff for a good while. He gets documents prepped for meetings and assignments and uses his free time to start stuff for us to add to once we are out of meetings/class. Really been doing a lot for us and he's been a huge help to the team.","rossmichaelwilliam"

"Sophia G. Shannon",3,3,5,3,5,"This person was out sick during the week that the demo was due, and she was my partner, so I had to built the demo mainly by myself. However, to make up for it she did cover my presentation slides since I was busy with the demo. It wasn't really her fault since she was sick so I guess the only thing I can say to improve on is to be careful with the people you are around.","lasherjefferythomasrobertctc"
"Sophia G. Shannon",4,2,3,3,3,"(DOUBLE CLICK TO SEE ENTIRE COMMENT PLEASE) Usually goes above and beyond but began to lose impact over the second half of the quarter. Albeit, they did get sick near the final week, there was not a lot of assistance/input that was provided during that time period meaning the group essentially only had 3 members for a rather ambitious prototype endeavor. Regardless, still motivates the group to bring a good attitude and good work to the table.","masonchristianakuto"
