"Zhuangzhuang Li",4,2,1,1,2,"He barely shows up to any lab sections and sponsor meetings due to work. He is trying to figure out a better schedule with Mohamed but it still hasn’t resolved.

"William Trong Duc Tran",5,4,4,4,4,"William not ony has relevant skills to this project, but has worked with Professor Velez to aquire the new skill of magnetic simulation. Since Bridge and I are leaving at the end of this quarter, William was chosen to do the magnetic simulations as they will be needed in the continuation of this project next quarter. I have been pleasantly suprised as to the quality of his work and his ability to pick up a new skill so fast. Even though he was left mostly on his own for the simulations, he pulled through and has given us good information to work off of.","czaplafranciszeknoel"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,3,3,3,3,"Pretty well balanced. It is tough to say of the grasp that he has of the project concept since his involvement of the project is with the simulation which won't come into play until later along the quarter. However, he is a good team player and helps where he can. I would suggest getting involved with the other factors of the project and not just simulation. ","perezwilfredo"
"William Trong Duc Tran",5,5,4,3,4,"It feels a bit unfair to rank him this way however he chose to learn the simulation software but he has been progressing slowly which makes it hard to confirm other design decisions. I guess my feedback would be that it would have been nice if he had managed his time better so he wasn't trying to learn the software in the middle part of the quarter when other responsibilities tend to stack up. ","robinsonbridgedarrah"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,4,4,3,3,"I try to help my team the best I can, but I have a niche role as simulations and I'm unable to perform any until we get further along our project. So while I do a little bit more my share of work for class assignments (PDP, PDR, etc), I feel like I have not contributed much progress to the development of the EPM.","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,5,3,5,4,"William is learning the simulations as fast as he can while working with professor Velez. I feel he can improve his rating by being a little more pushy with our sponsor since his aspect of the project is crucial to the progress of the rest of us. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Wilfredo Perez",3,4,4,3,3,"Wilfredo has relevant skills that are needed I this project, such as CAD and good team organization skills. He has recorded most every meeting with our sponsor, which is benefical for the reviewing o information after the fact. My only complaint would be that when I creaed a CAD model of our design, instead of working on mine he instead made his own, which seems like a waste of time that could have been used to further our progress","czaplafranciszeknoel"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,3,3,4,"Needs to improve in becoming a team player. Often times, prefers to do work on his own in order to meet his own expectations of the quality of work he should deliver. Needs to be more communicative when he feels that a lot of work load is being put on him.","perezwilfredo"
"Wilfredo Perez",4,5,3,4,4,"Wilfredo has been doing awesome work but needs to sharpen his engineering communication skills. He built a new Solidworks model from scratch even though Franek was about 90% done with one which I thought was odd. He also would not make a table comparing magnets while he was sourcing them even though I asked him to several times. He got key dimensions wrong also when he made his Solidworks model which frankly was very frustrating as we had clearly gone over the desired dimensions in our meeting with our sponsor. ","robinsonbridgedarrah"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,5,3,4,"Although not starting with much experience, Wilfredino has really applied himself in researching about our topic of EPMs as well as finding where to source our magnets. Definitely the hardest worker on the team, though he gets a standard score of 3 for keeping team on track because Bridge handled leadership.","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,4,3,4,5,"Wilfredo is very determined in his work. He has a lot to learn in regards to content and experience and you can tell from interactions with him. He is unsure of himself and that is probably the best way he can improve his rating, by being confident in his work and not needing reassurance throughout the project. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Wenhan Ji",4,5,5,5,5,"Do not possess strong knowledge background at first, but willlingly to learn in the assigned firld, communication with the team and make sure the team is moving toward the same direction","jiwenhan"

"Vincenzo Ethan Pizano",3,3,4,4,2,"I have noticed that I've grown more irritated with taking care of the team and maybe harsh when it comes to judging them.

"Vince Tran",4,4,5,3,5,"Vince is great, he's always the first to lab or any meeting which I definitely appreciate. Also proactive in making meeting slides and meeting prep which helps us all.
I think the main way to improve would just be checking in with the rest of us and seeing general progress/status and how to progress and avoid roadblocks. That being said, what he's currently doing is not a bad thing and is greatly appreciated.","rossmichaelwilliam"

"Torger William Berge",5,5,5,5,4,"Torger is very knowledgeable across many engeineering disciplines and has been an asset to the team. If there was an area he could improve on would be his attention to detail when completing tasks and milestones. He could spend more time in quality inspection, and also less time doing solo work.","chenericl"

"Tom Nguyen",4,4,5,5,5,"Learn more about aerodynamics and other areas related to project to make better design decisions and do calculations where necessary","nguyentom"
"Tom Nguyen",2,3,4,3,3,"Tom Nguyen interacts decently and helps with keeping track of the work, but I question his knowledge considering he made some mistakes when he made mistakes solving a total energy equation for our preliminary design and wants to cut corners with respect to mathematically explaining project material.","pizanovincenzoethan"
"Tom Nguyen",4,4,5,4,4,"Could help with team organization.","trandarronvinn"

"Tom Nguyen",3,3,4,4,5,"Your input can be questionable. Firearm are relatively not important in our project.","wukristy"
"Tarik Omar Assami",3,4,4,3,4,"The worst rating for Tarik is his relevant KSAs and keeping the team on track. He isn't necessarily bad at them, but there is room for improvement. One way to improve this would be to have him ask for more regular updates from his team to see how they are doing and check in if they need any help. For KSA, brushing up on Solidworks simulations can be a major help in terms of structural analysis.","assamitarikomar"
"Tarik Omar Assami",5,5,5,3,5,"gets work done with pleanty of time for revisions, not team leader so just does his portion of assigned work which is totally fine but why I gave a 3 for (keeping team on track)","dahmconnerbarrett"

"Sophia G. Shannon",5,5,4,5,5,"I think Sophia tends to get a little defensive when criticism is brought up, or if there tends to be a little dispute on how she is doing things and how they can be improved. I just think that she can be a little open minded and more patient.","lasherjefferythomasrobertctc"
"Sophia G. Shannon",4,5,5,4,4,"Usually goes above and beyond when it comes to the presentation of the group. Most members trust their opinion/input. Very encouraging.

She's informed about different components, system purpose, and how it all comes together which has been really helpful in making these meetings effective. She's also the one that seems to make sure we're on track the most and will text about stuff that I'd forgotten, so it has been very beneficial.
I can't really think of how to improve without being hypocritical. I think just generally speaking spending more time on it is better, but that can be said for anyone (including myself) and she already spends a lot of time on it so I think it's going very well.","rossmichaelwilliam"
