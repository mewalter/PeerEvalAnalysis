"William Trong Duc Tran",5,5,4,5,4,"Person C3 can improve by communicating with team on a slighter more consistent basis and expecting better quality work from teammates instead of picking up their lack of effort and taking on that workload without saying anything.","barrancolunamarthaleticia"
"William Trong Duc Tran",3,3,5,4,4,"William, like me, was interested in proving himself an engineer through this project. It was apparent that he wanted to help out, and he did whenever he could. Unfortunately,  I felt like I couldn't ask for his help in the lab most of the time given that he had to drive both his brother and himself back home (since they both drive to school together). And due to his long commute time, I didn't feel like I had the liberty to ask him to join me in the lab. Despite this, he often tried to find out what progress had been made and how he could contribute, providing me with ideas I hadn't thought of from time to time. William has the potential to do great work, but he is hindered by a lack of discipline. He would, unfortunately, put off work often because his friends wanted to meet or play videogames with him.","perezwilfredo"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,4,5,4,4,"Having Relevant Knowledge: It is important to not only do the necessary research, but to also document this research for myself and for team members. ","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"William Trong Duc Tran",4,4,4,4,4,"William is a very good teammate and knowleadgable on the project itself. He is very timid and not as confident in himself as he should be. That would be my only point of improvement for him. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,5,3,4,"Person B2 can improve by not letting others take advantage of him as in taking on the workload and responsibilities of team members instead of confronting them about their lack of effort and contribution.","barrancolunamarthaleticia"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,3,4,5,"Wilfredo was conflicted on many occasions as a result of this project. He became aware of some of the difficulties that being a leader entails. Difficulties, which prior to his role as a leader, he was unaware of. He wanted to give it his all because he had something he wanted to prove to himself, but knew he could not expect nor demand the same level of commitment from the rest of his team. Wilfredo learned over time that his teammates just wanted to get by in the class and didn't really care much for the project. As a result, he took it on himself to fulfill the project no matter the cost. Though Wilfredo wanted to be a great leader and seeked input from his teammates, he had put many more hours into the project and was unable to place the right amount of value on his team's opinion, because on most occassions, he knew things that the rest of the team didn't. Wilfredo regretted not being very comminicative with his team, but doing so would've heavily subtracted from the time he had available to do meaningfull work. Though he truly wanted to trust and rely on his team, something invaluable was at play for him, and in the end, he chose to trust himself.  ","perezwilfredo"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,5,4,4,"Expecting Quality: It would be a good quality as the team leader to review all works as whole before submitting assignments. Since ""divide and conquer"" was our main approach on assignments, its important that teach part integrates with each other. You however had your time diverted to doing a large portion of work.","tranwilliamtrongduc"
"Wilfredo Perez",5,5,3,2,3,"Wilfredo as a team leader was quite lackluster and did not keep the team on track to finish assignments on time. We were all very focused on singular tasks and delegating was not his strongest ability. He should work on being able to communicate goals and objectives clearly to the entire team while also being decisive and finalizing decisions earlier that impact the project greatly because that did slow us down significantly. ","weiseisaacjoaquin"
"Vincenzo Ethan Pizano",4,4,3,4,5,"Displayed excellent contribution to work and is knowledgeable. Needs to work highly on communicating with the team. Very last minute on certain deadlines.","limaaron"
"Vincenzo Ethan Pizano",4,4,2,4,2,"I gave almost all my time to this project and nearly dictated all the actions needed for it to reach the product stage. I made all the wings, I helped with 20% of the fuselage, I handled 3D printing, I did around 40% of the work for the presentations, I had to guide the design of the launcher, and I even had to tell some of my teammates to help with this part of the project when they sat back in silence. I became increasingly tired by the end of the quarter as I poured in up to 8 hrs per day working on the project from weeks 7-10. I know that I could do better with interactions with the team and expecting quality, but it felt as though I did nearly 50% of this project. I could react more kindly and give quality feedback, but my patience ran thin as I grew more tired. I also doubted my teammates ability which lead me to pouring in a large amount of hours into this project; I felt that due to the lack of innitatitve from my teammates and the fact that I needed to help in design, printing, and management of all the work, I was one of the only people that could make this project successful.

"Vincenzo Ethan Pizano",5,5,4,4,2,"Although understandable on why you have low expecting quality, you should still try to push for other members to do their works, especially if you are the team leader. Additionally, you have been less communicative since last quarter. Commands for readjustment are often given late, which is not beneficial to the team. However, you did try your best to help other members out in the process. ","wukristy"
"Vince Tran",5,5,5,4,5,"Good job! Help organize group tasks","martinezchihakcamille"
"Vince Tran",4,4,5,4,4,"Vince has been great, although lately it has definitely been a bit of a decline. He is usually the one that gets stuff started for us in his free time and lays out a good foundation/structure to build on. Towards the end of the quarter, though, it definitely became obvious that much of the work he does is regurgitation of past work that he doesn't truly understand the meaning of. Hearing him speak in certain presentations brings to light some blatant problems where he says something incorrect or doesn't truly know the specifics of the system. The worst part, though, was when it came to the final design binder. He did a great job getting a document started and providing a general format, but much of what he did was copy/paste from past project work. He provided many images and diagrams from past work, but did not provide a description or anything. This resulted in most of his work needing to be edited/revised by me, and I ultimately did probably 90-95% of the final design binder. He did give a fair warning that he would be unable to do any work on Friday, but the fact it came down to this is just insane.","rossmichaelwilliam"

"Michael William Ross",5,5,4,3,4,"I have not done as much as I would like with some parts of the project, but I most definitely have not been slacking. I have coordinated all of the meetings with external representatives--meetings that really should have been arranged by one of the old members last quarter--and took time to meet with people on top of my already very busy schedule. I put a lot of effort into my work for this project and I truly enjoy the work that I am doing for this, but it is quite tiring when I am the only one that understand the technical aspects of this and is expected to do the majority of the work with that.","rossmichaelwilliam"

"Martha Leticia Barranco Luna",3.5,4,4,4,4,"Martha has the potential to deliver great work, but she deprives herself of enough time to do so. This is understandable as she has a busy schedule. She significantly improved during the second half of the quarter as she got more involved in the project. After speaking with Martha, she agreed to spend part of her weekends to work on the project when she had previously limited her schedule to only work on weekdays, this was very beneficial and everyone in the team is grateful for it. Though she got a bit unlucky being put into our team (based on the decisions that were made on the first quarter, our team had to start from scratch this quarter),  I was very fortunate for having her as a team member, and truly appreciate all the help she and her boyfriend gave me.

"Kristy Wu",3,3,5,4,4,"Kristy was probably the member that helped the most with this project, she managed well and remained positive when I was feeling tired. I needed to guide her a bit in terms of the design of the launcher, but the main issue was that she decided upon the parts too late. I previously thought she finished the launcher, but it turns out that she needed to redesign it using wood since her first design considered aluminum which she previously thought we can CNC when it was easier to just buy as rods and plates. If she just realized to look for those, then I believe our launcher would operate better.

"Isaac Joaquin Weise",3,3,2,3,2,"Isaac was nonexistent for most of the quarter. He would only work and show up to present his portion of the in-lab presentations. His lack of involvement and knowledge with the project's progress often got the team in trouble with our sponsor. It got to a point where the team had to split work amongst its members as if it only consisted of three, and not four. I know Isaac has problems at home, but I don't believe they justify his actions. His lack of interest in the project was more than apparent whenever he would miss meetings, and not attempt to join them through Zoom as a result of his stomach aches.  Fortunately, Isaac was willing to make up for his errors during the last two weeks of the quarter and took on the workload of others to account for his absence. This was very helpful as he helped cover for my necessary absence during the last week. Though I am very grateful, that he helped out in the end, the whole team wishes he would've helped out throughout the quarter or had at least made more of an effort to stay in the loop. The only recommendations I can give Isaac are to get involved and to be communicative with the team. ","perezwilfredo"

In addition to this, while it was top priority to meet and exceed expectations, some corners had to be cut when certain issues of the project could not be solved this late into manufacturing... While the member did end up becoming an ""enabler"" it was done due to other members not being able to utilize the machine shop. This allowed the member to develop many skills and confidence in the aforementioend but it did cause 20+ hours to be put in the project per week when it could have been divided amongst others. This allowed for better delegation of tasks, discussion of the project, and more. Other members' input as well as contributions were greatly valued and it is always great to hear their ideas.

She does not seem to have basic knowledge to do work on this project, and has often expressed concerns about her ability to contribute to different tasks. This became increasingly evident as work progressed throughout the quarter, and was highlighted at the Annual Design Review when a representative from Broadcom said verbatum ""Alright, Camille doesn't want a job."" This was his response when she was unable to provide an answer to a basic question he asked since I was the only one talking. What really tops it all, though, is that she did not contribute to the final design binder. I have nothing against Camille personally, but the sheer fact that the three paragraphs she included were clearly directly from ChatGPT and were only started AFTER the binder due date already past was ridiculous. I absolutely grinded to get that done, along with other final papers and projects due today, and her excuse was ""I didn't know it was due at 1:30, I thought it was due at midnight."" Even so, from 2:00-6:00, her contribution consisted solely of incorrect work evidently from ChatGPT that I had to go in and correct. This was just a bit insane.","rossmichaelwilliam"

This member would constantly put extra hours into the project without being asked to and was consistent on asking for assistance from the other members to complete tasks that they were qualified to do.
